# Salon Project - Routing Implementation

## Overview
This project now includes React Router for navigation between different service pages. The routing system allows users to navigate to specific service pages from the navbar.

## File Structure

### Pages Directory (`src/pages/`)
- `HomePage.jsx` - Main home page that includes all existing components
- `HairServicePage.jsx` - Hair service page (uses existing hairservice component)
- `NailServicePage.jsx` - Nail service page with service listings
- `SkinBodyServicePage.jsx` - Skin & Body service page with service listings
- `ServicePage.css` - Shared styles for service pages

### Updated Components
- `App.jsx` - Now includes React Router setup with BrowserRouter and Routes
- `Navbar.jsx` - Updated to use React Router Link components for navigation

## Routes
- `/` - Home page (default route)
- `/hair-service` - Hair service page
- `/nail-service` - Nail service page  
- `/skin-body-service` - Skin & Body service page

## Navigation
- Desktop: Dropdown menu under "Services" with links to each service page
- Mobile: Submenu under "Services" with links to each service page
- All navigation uses React Router Link components for proper routing

## Features
- Responsive design for all service pages
- Consistent styling across service pages
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Proper routing with React Router DOM

## Usage
Users can now click on any service in the navbar dropdown to navigate to the dedicated service page. Each service page has its own content and styling while maintaining the overall site design.
